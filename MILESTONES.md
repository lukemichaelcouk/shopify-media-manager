## Development Workflow Strategy

### Live Development on Main
**Branch**: `main` (for immediate live deployment)  
Work directly on main branch for real-time changes to the live site.

### Creating Milestone Branches
Before major changes or when significant functionality is complete:

```bash
# Create a milestone branch from current main state
git checkout -b milestone-v1.1.0
git push -u origin milestone-v1.1.0

# Return to main for continued development
git checkout main

# Optional: Create a tag as well
git tag -a v1.1.0-milestone -m "Description of milestone"
git push origin v1.1.0-milestone
```

### Recovering Lost Functionality
If functionality is lost during development on main:

1. **Check milestone branches**: Review this file for the last known working state
2. **Compare with milestone**: `git diff milestone-v1.0.0` to see what changed
3. **Cherry-pick fixes**: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>` from milestone branch
4. **Reset to milestone**: `git reset --hard milestone-v1.0.0` as last resort
5. **Restore specific files**: `git checkout milestone-v1.0.0 -- filename.js`

### Useful Git Commands
```bash
# List all milestones
git tag -l

# View milestone details
git show v1.0.0-milestone

# Switch to milestone state
git checkout v1.0.0-milestone

# Compare current state with milestone
git diff v1.0.0-milestone

# Return to development
git checkout development
```

## Future Milestones (Planned)

### v1.1.0-milestone (Planned)
- Enhanced image optimization features
- Batch processing improvements
- Additional file format support
- Performance optimizations

### v1.2.0-milestone (Planned)
- Advanced filtering options

**Note**: Always create a new milestone before implementing major changes or when completing significant feature sets. This ensures we can always recover working functionality.
